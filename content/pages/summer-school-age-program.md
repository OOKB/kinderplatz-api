## Summer Programming

An experienced team of teachers and assistants plans and implements a wide variety of activities aimed at extending children’s learning throughout the summer.

When there is enough interest, an experienced teacher sets up a separate classroom for a full summer school-age program. Otherwise, when space allows, summer care for school-age children is available by special arrangement (and occasionally during the school year, as well). School-age children may join younger classrooms as “helpers” and occasionally gather as a small group with other school-age students for special projects and outings with a teacher.

### Curriculum

The summer curriculum includes educational elements, and many that are just for fun, such as: creative and environmentally-based learning experiences, pre-reading and independent reading activities, and math exercises and science projects. Attending school-age children participate in the Center’s on-going cultural enrichment activities, as well. Summer programming includes numerous field trips, in-house events, fun physical games and activities, and regular educational projects to keep their minds and bodies active throughout the summer.
