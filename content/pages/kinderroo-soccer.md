### Kinderroo Soccer Program

Kinderroo Instructional Soccer for (potty-trained) children 3 through 8 yrs. of age:

Kinderroo soccer practices are held weekly during the summer months (usually on Wednesday mornings). Each summer’s practice dates will be announced on, or prior to, the first day of summer programming. Soccer practices may be rescheduled due to inclement weather or scheduled field trips, as needed.

Experienced soccer coaches implement various Kinderroo levels, as outlined below. The children are grouped into separate teams based on children’s ages and developmental readiness. Depending on enrollment, each classroom will have one to two teams.
