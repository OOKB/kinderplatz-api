## Curriculum and Assessments

Kinderplatz uses child-initiated studies in combination with nationally recognized curriculum and assessment tools — Creative Curriculum and Teaching Strategies GOLD® — for infants through pre-kindergarten. The curriculum is environmentally and relationship based, and at the same time defines the role of the teacher in connecting content, teaching and learning. Teaching Strategies GOLD® allows teachers to assess all learners across “38 research-based objectives that include predictors of school success and are aligned with the Common Core State Standards, state early learning guidelines, and the Head Start Child Development and Early Learning Framework. These help teachers focus on what matters most for children’s success” ([www.teachingstrategies.com](http://www.teachingstrategies.com/)). Kinderplatz teachers use the Teaching Strategies GOLD® assessment tools and the Tadpoles app Child Portfolios for recording daily observations and child progress. Teachers also work with families daily to share about their observations, to understand each family’s wishes, and to plan for next developmental steps.

The comprehensive curriculum helps teachers create the very best learning experience plan for their students, and the child assessment system allows the tracking of individual developmental progress. The children flourish in a consistent and nurturing environment with appropriately challenging experiences.

The curriculum is implemented using an active, child-centered program with play as the primary vehicle for learning. We encourage art in every aspect of the curriculum. Children also learn through cognitive activities, dramatic play, science, games, books, blocks, music, and creative movement. Sign language, Spanish language instruction, Spanish immersion (for those who opt in to the language immersion preschool program) and other cultural enrichment programs are also an integral part of the Kinderplatz curriculum.

With the help of Teaching Strategies GOLD®, the teachers are able to offer a variety of experiences in response to children's growing abilities, personalities, interests and needs. By providing an environment rich in choice and variety, each child engages in experiences relevant to his or her stage of development.

We work to meet each child’s unique developmental needs while preparing them for success in kindergarten and beyond.

Kinderplatz recommends that children arrive no later than 9:00am to best benefit from the curriculum.
