## Diversity

Our program is designed with the diverse backgrounds of the children we care for in mind. We place particular emphasis on the introduction and celebration of world cultures as a way to prepare children to live in today’s interconnected, multi-cultural community. Program activities also focus on helping children resist bias and learn social competence skills. Kinderplatz is not affiliated with any religious organizations – the beliefs of all children and their families are honored and respected.
