## Community

We are committed to instilling a sense of community by helping children learn the importance of teamwork, caring for the environment, and playing a positive, active role in the world around them. Community awareness is promoted through field trips, in-house events, the involvement of community resources, local companies, and Center friends and family. These types of activities are planned as a regular part of children’s curriculum and are intended to enhance classroom learning.

Along with these fun activities, we involve family members and others in the community in ways that enhance the children’s learning. We have had friends and family members who are: firefighters, police officers, pilots, veterinary technicians, bakers, and many others — come to share and do projects with the children.
