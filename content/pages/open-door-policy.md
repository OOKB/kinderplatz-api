## Open Door Policy

Our Open Door Policy (below) will be re-implemented when deemed appropriate by the CDC and the MDH. Currently, for everyone's health and safety, a very limited number of classroom visitors are allowed into classrooms only by appointment and under supervision and strict Visitor Protocol Guidelines.

We have an “open door” policy at Kinderplatz. Parents may visit their children in our facilities any time they wish. Visiting parents are encouraged to participate in the classroom curriculum and routine during visits to avoid disrupting existing classroom schedules and activities. If you wish to meet with the Director or a staff member, please make an appointment so that appropriate staffing arrangements can be made.

Kinderplatz appreciates parents’ valuable input on the care of their children and encourages parent participation. Parents can visit as much or as little as their schedules (and children) will allow. Many breastfeeding mothers enjoy taking advantage of this benefit daily.
