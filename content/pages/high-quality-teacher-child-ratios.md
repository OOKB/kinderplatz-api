## High Quality Teacher-Child Ratios

Low child-to-teacher ratios improve the overall quality of care for all children at Kinderplatz.

### The Child-Teacher Ratios at Kinderplatz are as follows:

|                          |                         |
| ------------------------ | ----------------------- |
| Infants & Young Toddlers | 1 Teacher / 4 Children  |
| Older Toddlers           | 1 Teacher / 6 Children  |
| Young Preschool          | 1 Teacher / 9 Children  |
| Preschool/Pre-K          | 1 Teacher / 10 Children |
| School-Age               | 1 Teacher / 15 Children |

In addition to each classroom’s regular teaching staff, a team of 3-7 “Floater Teachers” arrives at the center each morning prepared to assist and support classroom teaching teams as needed.
