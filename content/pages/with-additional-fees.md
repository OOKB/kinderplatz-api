## Programs with Additional Fees

### Field Trips

The weekly summer field trip schedule is available in May each spring. Potty-trained preschoolers do go on a handful of field trips during the school year as well, and information about those outings will be available on a per-trip basis once planned.

Our adventures take us to popular local destinations for apple- and pumpkin-picking, roller skating and bowling, history hunts, hiking and picnics, children’s plays, visits with zoo animals, swimming, ball games and much more.

### Kinderroo Soccer

Potty-trained children have the opportunity to enroll in the Kinderplatz in-house Kinderroo soccer program during the summer months. Experienced soccer coaches implement various Kinderroo levels based on children’s ages and developmental readiness. Depending on enrollment, each classroom will have one to two teams that meet weekly for lessons.
