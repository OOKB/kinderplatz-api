## Variable Cost Programs

### In-House Events

Throughout each year, in-house events are planned for all the children at Kinderplatz, including the infants. As many of our children cannot yet go on group field trips, we bring the field trips to them! We have had exciting bubble parties, concerts by childrenâ€™s bands, elaborate story-tellers, magicians, and more!
