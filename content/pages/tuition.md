## Tuition

All rates listed below include most enrichment programs, as well as lunch and snacks (does not include special dietary requirements). Some activity fees are charged separately. Tuition is due in full by 10:00 every Tuesday. A late fee of $30 (per week) is applied to any past due charges and returned checks.

Electronic forms of payment are strongly preferred. Paying via an active electronic payment account will keep the account current and avoid assessment of late payment fees. Please contact our Director of Accounts and Operations to set up electronic payments.

Kinderplatz accepts families who receive child care subsidies from various county or government assistance programs, including Military Subsidy programs.

*TUITION FEES AND POLICIES September 2, 2024 - August 29, 2025*

The fees and policies will be re-evaluated prior to September to determine appropriate annual increase.
