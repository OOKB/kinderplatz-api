## Tuition

All rates listed below include most enrichment programs, as well as lunch and snacks (does not include special dietary requirements). Some activity fees are charged separately. Tuition is due in full by 10:00 every Tuesday. A late fee of $30 (per week) is applied to any past due charges and returned checks.

Electronic forms of payment are strongly preferred. Paying via an active electronic payment account will keep the account current and avoid assessment of late payment fees. Please contact our Director of Accounts and Operations to set up electronic payments.

Kinderplatz accepts families who receive child care subsidies from various county or government assistance programs, including Military Subsidy programs.

*TUITION FEES AND POLICIES September 4, 2023 - August 30, 2024*

The fees and policies will be re-evaluated prior to September pending status of health crisis and state grant funding.

**§:** Sibling Discount of 10% off tuition is available for additional (older) child(ren) for full-time families with (all) siblings on a full-time schedule.

**Ɨ:** Infant enrollment is highly competitive and start dates are often confirmed up to six months prior to the child’s first day. Please plan ahead and turn in enrollment forms early to avoid missing the enrollment window. Openings are not guaranteed with late enrollment, regardless of federal employment status and sibling preference. Every effort will be made to honor start date requests, but flexibility from families may be required.

**ƥ:** Payment options provided separately. Please see Association Bylaws in our Parent Policy Handbook for more information.
